# ALX Airbnb Database — Advanced SQL Project

## About the project
This project is part of the ALX Airbnb Database module. Implement advanced SQL querying and optimization techniques against a simulated Airbnb database, covering query performance tuning, complex script development, indexing, and partitioning to prepare for large-scale, high-performance applications.

## Learning objectives
By the end of this project you will:
- Master advanced SQL: joins, subqueries, and aggregations for retrieval and analysis.
- Optimize query performance using tools like EXPLAIN and ANALYZE.
- Implement indexing and table partitioning to improve performance on large datasets.
- Monitor and refine performance: continuously assess database health and refine schemas and queries.
- Think like a DBA: make data-driven schema and optimization decisions for high-volume systems.

## Requirements
- Solid understanding of SQL fundamentals (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY).
- Familiarity with relational concepts: primary keys, foreign keys, normalization.
- Basic knowledge of performance tools: EXPLAIN, ANALYZE.
- Ability to set up and manage a GitHub repository for submission.

## Key highlights
1. Defining relationships with ER diagrams  
    Create an ER diagram modeling users, bookings, properties, and reviews; define relationships and dependencies.

2. Complex queries with joins  
    Practice INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN to combine tables and extract insights.

3. Power of subqueries  
    Use correlated and non-correlated subqueries for nested analysis (e.g., average ratings, activity filters).

4. Aggregations and window functions  
    Apply COUNT, SUM and window functions like ROW_NUMBER and RANK for ranking and analytics.

5. Indexing for optimization  
    Identify bottlenecks, create indexes on frequently queried columns, and measure impact on execution time.

6. Query optimization techniques  
    Refactor complex queries to reduce redundancy and leverage indexes for faster execution.

7. Partitioning large tables  
    Implement table partitioning (focus on Booking table) to speed date-range queries and compare before/after performance.

8. Performance monitoring and schema refinement  
    Use SHOW PROFILE and EXPLAIN ANALYZE to identify bottlenecks, propose schema changes, implement adjustments, and document results.

This workflow emphasizes both efficient SQL authoring and strategic database design for real-world, high-performance applications.
